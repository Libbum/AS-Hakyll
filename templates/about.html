<p>My name is Tim DuBois and I'm presently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Chalmers University of Technology with the <a href="http://ft.nephy.chalmers.se/">Electromagnetic Field Theory Group</a> in Gothenburg, Sweden. The research I'm undertaking is part of the PLasma based ION Acceleration (PLIONA) Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation project, which will attempt to generate high acceleration laser-plasma based ion sources for near future use in applications such as hadron therapy for cancers, cosmic radiation studies on living cells and spacecraft, short-life medical isotope production, proton imaging and many other important applications.</p>

<p>I obtained my doctorate at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia in September 2015 with the <a href="http://tcqp.science">Chemical and Quantum Physics Group</a>. That research focused on microscopic models of defects and quantum transport in condensed matter systems and large scale computer simulation using <i>ab initio</i> techniques. From August 2009 until September 2015 I was also contracted by the <a href="http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/">Defence Science and Technology Organisation</a>; specialising in statistical properties of Lagrangian particles in application to the areas of turbulent dispersion, release characterisation and blast dynamics.</p>

<p>Lazarus Long, a character is Robert Heinlein's <i>Time Enough for Love</i> stated that "Specialization is for insects"&mdash;a sentiment which I tend to embrace, with qualifications and academic training in Ancient Languages, Philosophy, Electronics, Ecology, and Computer Science along side Physics.</p>

<p>Outside of academic pursuits; my interests include <a href="https://odyssey.neophilus.net">travelling</a>, rock climbing, trampoline gymnastics, <a href="https://phoenix.exactlyinfinite.com/">building multirotor uavs</a>, <a href="https://cqplabs.neophilus.net/">building stupid shit</a>, <a href="https://www.neophilus.net/whispers/">art</a> and making friends with neighbourhood cats.</p>
