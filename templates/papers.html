        <div id="1503.03160" class="abstract">The dynamics of particle transport under the influence of localised high energy anomalies (explosions) is a complicated phenomena dependent on many physical parameters of both the particle and the medium it resides in. Here we present a conceptual model that establishes simple scaling laws for particle dispersion in relation to the energy released in a blast, properties of the medium, physical properties of particles and their initial position away from a blast epicenter. These dependencies are validated against numerical simulations and we discuss predictions of the model which can be validated experimentally. Other applications and extensions to the framework are also considered.</div>

        <div id="1503.01859" class="abstract">The microscopic structure of ultra-thin oxide barriers often plays a major role in modern nano-electronic devices. In the case of superconducting electronic circuits, their operation depends on the electrical non-linearity provided by one or more such oxide layers in the form of ultra-thin tunnel barriers (also known as Josephson junctions). Currently available fabrication techniques manufacture an amorphous oxide barrier, which is attributed as a major noise source within the device. The nature of this noise is currently an open question and requires both experimental and theoretical investigation. Here, we present a methodology for constructing atomic scale computational models of Josephson junctions using a combination of molecular mechanics, empirical and ab initio methods. These junctions consist of ultra-thin amorphous aluminium-oxide layers sandwiched between crystalline aluminium. The stability and structure of these barriers as a function of density and stoichiometry are investigated, which we compare to experimentally observed parameters.</div>

Focussing on so called 'strongly coupled' two-level defects, we construct a theoretical model using the atomic position of the oxygen which is spatially delocalized in the oxide forming the JJ barrier. Using this model, we investigate which atomic configurations give rise to two-level behaviour of the type seen in experiments. We compute experimentally observable parameters for phase qubits and examine defect response under the effects of applied electric field and strain.</div>

        <div id="10.1175/JAS-D-12-0268.1" class="abstract">Experimental results for passive tracer dispersion in the turbulent surface layer under convective conditions are presented. In this case, the dispersion of tracer particles is determined by the interplay of two mechanisms: buoyancy and advection. In the atmospheric surface layer under unstable stratification the buoyancy mechanism dominates when the distance from the ground is greater than the Monin–Obukhov length, resulting in a different exponent in the scaling law for relative separation of Lagrangian particles (a deviation from the celebrated Richardson’s law). This conclusion is supported by atmospheric observations. Exit-time statistics and a probability density function of concentration increments derived from a previously published experimental dataset demonstrate a noticeable difference between tracer dispersion in the convective and neutrally stratified surface layers.</div>

        <div id="10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.077002" class="abstract">One of the key problems facing superconducting qubits and other Josephson junction devices is the decohering effects of bistable material defects. Although a variety of phenomenological models exist, the true microscopic origin of these defects remains elusive. For the first time we show that these defects may arise from delocalization of the atomic position of the oxygen in the oxide forming the Josephson junction barrier. Using a microscopic model, we compute experimentally observable parameters for phase qubits. Such defects are charge neutral but have nonzero response to both applied electric field and strain. This may explain the observed long coherence time of two-level defects in the presence of charge noise, while still coupling to the junction electric field and substrate phonons.</div>

        <div id="10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.049" class="abstract">In this paper we statistically characterise the bio-aerosol background in an urban environment. To do this we measure concentration levels of naturally occurring microbiological material in the atmosphere over several days. Naturally occurring bio-aerosols can be considered as noise, as they mask the presence of signals coming from biological material of interest (such as an intentionally released biological agent). Analysis of this 'biobackground' was undertaken in the 1&mdash;10 &micro;m size range and a 3&mdash;9% contribution was found to be biological in origin e values which are in good agreement with other studies reported in the literature. A model based on the physics of turbulent mixing and dispersion was developed and validated against this analysis. The Gamma distribution (the basis of our model) is shown to comply with the scaling laws of the concentration moments of our data, which enables us to universally characterise both biological and non-biological material in the atmosphere. An application of this model is proposed to build a framework for the development of novel algorithms for bio-aerosol detection and rapid characterisation.</div>

        <div id="10.1103/PhysRevE.82.056304" class="abstract">Experimental results for passive tracer dispersion in the turbulent surface layer under stable conditions are presented. In this case, the dispersion of tracer particles is determined by the interplay of three mechanisms: relative dispersion (celebrated Richardson’s mechanism), shear dispersion (particle separation due to variation of the mean velocity field) and specific surface-layer dispersion (induced by the gradient of the energy dissipation rate in the turbulent surface layer). The latter mechanism results in the rather slow (ballistic) law for the mean squared particle separation. Based on a simplified Langevin equation for particle separation we found that the ballistic regime always dominates at large times. This conclusion is supported by our extensive atmospheric observations. Exit-time statistics are derived from the experimental data set and show a reasonable match with the simple dimensional asymptotes for different mechanisms of tracer dispersion, as well as predictions of the multifractal model and experimental data from other sources.</div>

          Constructing circuits which invoke the tunnelling effect of Josephson junctions in the superconducting regime manifest controllable, quantum properties. The development of a quantum computer employing these phenomena is just one of the many advantages to be gained from building such devices.<br><br />
          However, the use of quantum bits for computation is dependent on the ability to operate them in an essentially isolated environment. The phenomenon of decoherence refers to the instability of a quantum state of a system when it interacts with the surrounding environment. Superconducting qubits are sensitive to decoherence mechanisms within the readout leads connecting to the device, and more importantly from the materials from which they are manufactured. Removal or control of these imperfections is required before quantum computers using superconducting circuit architecture can be realised.<br><br />
          One identifiable noise source is the so called 'strongly coupled' two-level system (TLS). Comparable resonance frequencies to the qubit; strong coupling strengths and decoherence times long enough to allow coherent oscillations between the qubit and TLS have been experimentally measured. The premise of this thesis is that positional anharmonicity of oxygen atoms arises within the AlO<sub>x</sub> barrier of the Josephson junction solely due to its amorphous construction. This ansatz allows the existence of various spatial configurations throughout the layer, causing unique TLS properties based solely on atomic positions and rotation in relation to the external electric field.<br><br />
          To validate this conjecture, Josepson junction models are constructed using a hybrid <i>ab initio</i> and molecular mechanics approach, with various stoichiometry and density properties to reflect experimental observations of the barrier. The resultant atomic positions provide input conditions through a Voronoi classification scheme to a framework describing an oxygen atom that has the capacity to become spatially delocalised as bonds perturb away from a crystalline structure. A direct digitalisation method is developed for low dimensional descriptions and a Wick-rotated time-dependent Schrödinger equation implementation is used for three dimensional investigations.<br><br />
          Calculated properties are compared to many current experimental strongly coupled TLS measurements in phase qubits, which shows the models' capacity to explain how an oxygen atom can generate a large dipole and appropriate ground to first excited state splitting values expected of a TLS by merely migrating from its preferred lattice position.

        <div id="honours" class="abstract">Geodynamic processes are extremely difficult to investigate with current technologies. Rheology in the lithosphere and asthenosphere is highly nonlinear and elasticity causes complications near the surface when the ambient temperature is less than approximately 600&deg;C. The current contention between Geologists and Geophysicists is that the Earth’s main geodynamic process is that of Mantle Convection; exerting plate tectonics to organise the system. Considering that plate tectonics is only a kinematic description of observations though, and not a fully dynamic description of plate motion, this and other approximations and assumptions continue to build upon one another yielding incomplete and inconsistent models. Geothermobarometry is the science of measuring temperature and pressure histories of intrusive igneous or metamorphic rock in an attempt to understand these processes in a limited fashion.<br>
        The recent work complied on a Titanium-in-Quartz geothermometer by Wark &amp; Watson [Contrib. Mineral. Petrol. 152 (2006)] concluded with an empirical formula generated from the cathodoluminescence of a synthesised Quartz system in the presence of Rutile. The absence of a major pressure effect on the calibration is suggested, but could not be verified.<br>
        Generation of an <i>ab initio</i> model of a Ti defect in a SiO<sub>2</sub> crystal was undertaken to assist in validating the Ti/Quartz relationship at pressure and temperature over ranges of 0&mdash;11 GPa and 0&mdash;1500 K respectively. A Molecular Mechanics model was also constructed due to issues pertaining to the construction of the former. An analysis and comparison of the two models conclude that the Titanium-in-Quartz defect investigated showed a pressure dependence of less than 0.2% over the pressure range.</div>
