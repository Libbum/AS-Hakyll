My name is Tim DuBois and I'm presently a PhD candidate at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia with the [Chemical and Quantum Physics Group](http://tcqp.science). My current research focuses on microscopic models of defects and quantum transport in condensed matter systems and large scale computer simulation using <i>ab initio</i> techniques. Since 2009 I've also been contracted by the [Defence Science and Technology Organisation](http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/) specialising in statistical properties of lagrangian particles in application to the areas of turbulent dispersion, release characterisation and blast dynamics.

Currently, I'm in professional limbo as my PhD thesis is with international reviewers. Assuming positive feedback arrives in a few months; I will be relocating to Gothenburg, Sweden to join the [Electromagnetic Field Theory Research Group](http://ft.nephy.chalmers.se/) at Chalmers University of Technology.

Lazarus Long, a character is Robert Heinlein's *Time Enough for Love* stated that "Specialization is for insects"&mdash;a sentiment which I tend to embrace, with qualifications and academic training in Ancient Languages, Philosophy, Electronics and Computer Science along side Physics.

Outside of academic pursuits; my interests include rock climbing, trampoline gymnastics, [building multirotor uavs](https://phoenix.exactlyinfinite.com/), [building stupid shit](https://cqplabs.neophilus.net/), [art](https://neophilus.net/whispers/) and making friends with neighbourhood cats.
