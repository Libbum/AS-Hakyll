title: Unveiling some Makefile Black Magic

Whilst my higher education started off in the computer science realm, I quickly became disillusioned and, excluding a decent temporal shift, moved more into the physical sciences. Whilst I never finished my CS degree; what I completed gave me an adequate understanding of development life cycles, program design and sufficient competency in __c++__ to get shit done. When I started heavily coding again, forces shunted me towards __Matlab__ and higher level quick and dirty rapid prototyping. As we all know; you can only go so far in this world and I've recently found myself back into the depths with __c__, __fortran__ and even a little <!--BLURB--> __assembly__. 

Ultimately though, my __c++__ programs never needed to link to external libraries or worry about machine specific configurations the `-o` switch was the only one I needed when calling `gcc` pretty much. Now I'm building MPI tools to run on supercomputing clusters that need the highly optimised linear algebra routines; written down by our forefathers in a more civilised age. 

I need a Makefile, the file filled with dark arts known only to those with neck beards and ghostly white skin.

Realistically, Makefiles are relatively simple things, but seem to have a stigma associated with them if you're outside the computer science sphere. In fact; here's a quote from my PhD supervisor when I told him about my knowledge gain concerning this post:

> Hehe, careful.  Those that learn how to write makefiles are usually doomed to vanish .... banished to a basement (or IT department of a fortune 500 company) for all eternity.

I guess writing this post and publishing it on the internet is sealing my fate...

The _my first Makefile_ tutorials around the internet are not too bad (take a look at [WLUG](http://www.wlug.org.nz/MakefileHowto) and [Mrbook](http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/) to get started); but the Black Magic I eluded to in the title of this post is much cooler than just typing `make` instead of `g++ main.cpp interrobang.cpp -o omgwtfbbq`. 


### Pre-processor macros

---
The specific problem I needed to overcome was managing one set of code that requires different linking libraries depending on what machine it was running on.

* __Vayu__ uses intel compilers and requires the MKL libraries
* __Trifid__ uses gcc compilers and requires the blas and lapack libraries

Because of these conditions, code in certain files differ. For example, calls to linear algebra routines on __Vayu__ require an `MKL_int` type, whereas the same call on __Trifid__ asks for `int`. A pre-processor macro defining a generalised int type `LP_INT` enables me to overcome this problem. This macro uses an `if-elif-else` formalism to check what machine the code is compiling on and adds additional headers if needed: 

``` c
#if defined(VAYU)

#include <mkl>
#define LP_INT MKL_INT

#elif defined(TRIFID)

#define LP_INT int

#else

#error "One of VAYU or TRIFID must be defined"

#endif
```

Now, how can we define these `VAYU` and `TRIFID` variables? SUMMON THE MAKEFILE:

``` makefile
HOST_NAME := $(shell hostname)
ifeq ($(HOST_NAME),trifid)
LAPACK = /usr/local/lapack/3.4.2/lib/liblapack.so /usr/local/blas/1.0.248/lib/libblas.so -lm  
LIBS = -L/usr/local/lapack/3.4.2/lib
CXX = g++ #icpc
CPPFLAGS += -DTRIFID=1
else
INCLUDES += -I$(MKL)/include
LAPACK = -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_intel_thread -lmkl_core -liomp5 -lpthread  
LIBS = -L$(MKL)/lib/intel64 
CPPFLAGS += -DVAYU=1
endif
```

Grab the hostname of the machine & check it against known results (in my case I just check for _trifid_). Any shell call can be used here if hostname isn't appropriate. Then, setup the required libraries, includes and compiler information specific to the identified machine. Most importantly: append `CPPFLAGS` to incorperate a machine bool set to 1 which the pre-processor macros are looking for.

_Et voil√†!_ Call `make` on either machine and build without a hassle. No more merge conflicts between git branches for me. _A shoutout to [Ash](http://tuxdude.github.com/) who put me on the right path with this issue._
