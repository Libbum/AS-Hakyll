title: Workman layout for Vim
byline: For those of you who REALLY need to type using three layouts

I've recently switched keyboard layouts from Dvorak to [Workman](http://www.workmanlayout.com/blog/). Dvorak has been good to me over the past 5 years or so, but the philosophy behind it wasn't actualised in it's final design. Workman has been optimised for English and minimises finger strain etc etc. There's no point rabbiting on about it as all of my praises or critiques are already well fleshed out on the Workman website.

It's been two weeks or so since the switch and I'm at the proficiency stage where I'm not yelling at the awkwardness of my inability to find a letter, but if the switch from Qwerty to <!--BLURB--> Dvorak is any indication it'll be a couple of months until I'm completely up to speed.

I had a fantastic Vim map for Dvorak suggested by [Adam Davis](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/165231/vim-dvorak-keybindings-rebindings), which kept the Qwerty _h,j,k,l_ navigation keys in the same place; remapping sane Dvorak keys with minimal disruption. So obviously something similar for Workman that didn't disrupt Vim flow is needed.

Taking the laziest approach first; google tells me there are only two current suggestions. First, Matt Weolk has taken the complete remap Qwerty:Workman approach, which is outlined in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MattWoelk/887861) and takes the idea from _colqer_; a Colemak solution to the same issue. I really don't like the blind approach this method uses as I remember Vim keybindings more on their associations (y = yank), than muscle memory of their original Qwerty locations. The second solution is a simple _j <-> t_ switch discussed in [this](http://www.workmanlayout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=6) thread. Closer to what I'm after, and I used it for a while; but ultimately the navigation keys being separated and not entirely on the home row doesn't sit with me.

So, here's my attempt at a decent Workman remapping for Vim:

``` vim
    nnoremap l o
    nnoremap o l
    nnoremap L O
    nnoremap O L
    nnoremap j n
    nnoremap n j
    nnoremap J N
    nnoremap N J
    nnoremap k e
    nnoremap e k
    nnoremap K E
    nnoremap E <nop>
    nnoremap h y
    onoremap h y
    nnoremap y h
    nnoremap H Y
    nnoremap Y H
```

_h,j,k,l_ are replaced by the Workman _y,n,e,o_ home keys, with a few new associations:

* (__Y__)ank -> (__H__)aul
* Search (__N__)ext -> (__J__)ump
* (__E__)nd word -> brea(__K__) of word [yeah, that one's a push...]
* (__O__)pen new line -> (__L__)ine

Considering I now use three different layouts depending on where I am, I've had to set up a layout remap function in my .vimrc. Here it is in it's present state at the time of writing; check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Libbum/dotfiles) repository for updates though.
