title: Including Small Countries in Your world.json

In the process of building [Odyssey](https://odyssey.neophilus.net), I came across an omission in most of the world structures on [Bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/). Pretty much everyone nowadays grabs the [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) `ne_110m_admin_0_countries` dataset, converts it to [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson), throws the result to a projection such as

``` javascript
   d3.geo.orthographic().translate([width / 2, height / 2]).scale(width / 2 - 20).clipAngle(90)
```

and then move on with their lives.

But what if you care about information on this projection? What if Mike Bostock's [World Tour](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4183330) gave you this grandiose idea of an interactive globe for your website that needs to pinpoint tiny countries like Singapore? <!--BLURB--> &nbsp;

Singapore and other small countries like it are not included in the main 1:110m scale data as they are not large enough to be polytopes. Instead, they are relegated to `ne_110m_admin_0_tiny_countries` as point information and usually omitted from D3 1:110m globe implementations.  

Including this data set adds a small amount of complexity to the build and a bit of finessing of the finished product, but nothing over the top. I'll assume you have TopoJSON setup already and know how to use it. If not, checkout [Let's Make A Map](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) for a good overview. For the lazy ones you can grab the end result of the following steps from [here](/assets/world.json).

Get the latest data from Natural Earth. This can be whatever you want to combine; I'll be using just [countries](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip)
and [tiny country points](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_tiny_countries.zip), but it'd also be possible to use the sovereignty data in place of countries (for example) if you want to drill down a little deeper. Using the 1:50m or 1:10m sets is also fine, however I find that this is too precise (read: too much info) to animate smoothly on your grandma's computer or mobile devices.

Extract both sets into a new directory and convert the shape data to GeoJSON:
```
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON countries.json ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON tinycountries.json ne_110m_admin_0_tiny_countries.shp
```

We now need to manually merge these files. AFAIK, `ogr2ogr` isn't happy merging poly and non-poly geometry, and the `TopoJSON` command line tool doesn't merge stuff at all. It's possible to merge this data on the client side each load, but this seems pretty inefficient. One could write a simple shell script for this, but as we're only doing it once I see no need for automation. The GeoJSON format we have output with our two files above follows a simple syntax:
``` json
   { "type": "FeatureCollection", "features": [ ... ] }
```
with a plethora of `Feature` elements filling the array. To merge the data one must simply add a comma (`,`) to the last entry of the `countries.json` `features` array, then append the contents of the same array from `tinycountries.json`. For this example we'll save that file as `world.geo.json`.

Now, our newly created file can be converted to TopoJSON via
```
    topojson -o world.json --id-property su_a3 --properties name -- countries=world.geo.json
```
and loaded using a somewhat normal D3 map routine. The important part is the `d3.json` function. Here we don't use a mesh load but rather a path append:
``` javascript
d3.json("/assets/world.json", function(error, world) {
    if (error) throw error;

   var land = topojson.feature(world, world.objects.countries).features;

   svg.insert("g", ".graticule").attr("id", "countries");
   d3.selectAll("#countries").selectAll("path").data(land)
      .enter().append("path").attr("class", "land")
      .attr("id", function(d, i) { return d.id; }).attr("d", path);
 });
```
This, along with a little boiler plate (which you can view [here](https://bl.ocks.org/Libbum/e8cda20eea9d401f642357c4f46281e4)), gives us the following globe:
<div id="map"></div>
So what's going on with all of those dots everywhere? Well; they're our small countries, which are not represented by paths but rather just points. On this map they stick out like a sore thumb and it's for this reason they are separated out in the first place. We don't really want to see them either: just be able to reference them and zoom to their location.

To do this one can modify the `.data(land)` item to include a filter
``` javascript
.data(land.filter(function(d) { return d.geometry.type !== 'Point'; }))
```
which will give us back our normal looking globe. However, we now have a complete list of individual countries which we can reference via their `su_a3` id or name and in-turn, center the viewport on a country even if it isn't visible on this scale. The map below is filtering out ONLY tiny countries and giving you a world tour. Full codebase for this globe is [here](http://bl.ocks.org/Libbum/ec6a8df2049c6084106512e962788aa5).
<div id="countryName"></div>
<div id="map2"></div>
