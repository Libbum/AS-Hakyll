This blog was never intended to be of a personal nature, but looking through the content in the six months or so since its inception - it's not much of anything else either. When I set everything up here; my life was fairly consistent and plans of getting a heap of work done, blogging and a number of other side projects were on the cards. Soon after a metaphorical whirlwind came through and tore up pretty much every aspect of my life. Many things have laid dormant, this blog being one of the first. The storm is passing (I think), so a resurrection of this place is in order. Before that happens though, things have changed and new directions have been planned. 

<!--BLURB-->

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) has served me well as an introduction to static blogging, but Ruby has never been on my list of favoured languages, nor is it one I plan on picking up. Haskell on the other hand has been playing a major role recently, so as of 5 minutes after this post is published I'll be working on porting [Axiomatic Semantics](http://axiomatic.neophilus.net) to [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). A leaner site design (mobile friendly, latest web developments) is also on the cards to fix a number of bloated pieces of the current layout. 

Until that's all ready, this post will remain to let those of you who do come here once in a while that you have not been abandoned.
