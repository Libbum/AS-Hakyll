Excuses aside, I've decided to post what's done with the site re-design now so I have more of a reason to get it finished. My PhD completion seminar has been completed, so now I'm in hunkerdown-and-write mode. This basically means I'll need a bit of distraction during the next few months - and this is as good a place as any to be an outlet. Stay tuned.
